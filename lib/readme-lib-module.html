<h2>AspectJ library module</h2>

This module primarily contains binary libraries from open-source projects, 
some of which are subject to licenses other than the Common Public License (CPL).  
Those not subject to CPL are not distributed in source or binary form with
AspectJ (except for Apache's BCEL), but are used in the development of AspectJ.  
This module also contains some bootstrap libraries and test sources.

<ul>
   <li><a href="ant">ant</a>:
       Ant 1.5.1 from 
       <a ="http:jakarta.apache.org/ant">http:jakarta.apache.org/ant</a>.
       This contains a modified Ant script that works with our quicklook
       and puts the optional tasks on the classpath by default.
       Ant is available under the Apache Software License.
       </li>
   <li><a href="bcel">bcel</a>:
       The Bytecode Engineering Library from 
       <a ="http:jakarta.apache.org/bcel">http:jakarta.apache.org/bcel</a>,
       available under the Apache Software License.
       </li>
   <li><a href="build">build</a>: bootstrap libraries for the build process.
       </li>
   <li><a href="eclipse2.0">eclipse2.0</a>:
       The AspectJ compiler is a patch to the Eclipse 2.0 compiler.
       These are the non-compiler binaries.  For the eclipse compiler
       and patched, see the org.eclipse.jdt.core module.
       This is available under the CPL.
       </li>
   <li><a href="junit">junit</a>:
       JUnit 3.7 test libraries, available from 
       <a ="http:junit.org">junit.org</a> and under the CPL.
       </li>
   <li><a href="test">test</a>: bootstrap libraries for the test process.
       These could be replaced with build products, to avoid the checked-in
       versions being out of date, but these build products change rarely
       (and almost never in binary-incompatible ways).
