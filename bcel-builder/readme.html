<h1>The BCEL-builder module</h1>

<p> The contents of this directory are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>This file</li>
  <li>build.xml -- an ant script </li>
  <li>patch.txt -- a diff patchfile</li>
</ul>

<p> And pretty much nothing else.  Well, then, what do you do with
this directory?  Well, the whole point is to generate bcel/bcel.jar in
the lib package.  To do so, first stick
<strong>bcel-5.1-src.zip</strong> in this directory, then run ant.
(at one point, this was available at
<a href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/jakarta/bcel/source/bcel-5.1-src.zip">
http://archive.apache.org/dist/jakarta/bcel/source/bcel-5.1-src.zip</a>)
After much unzipping, patching, and compiling, you should get an
appropriate bcel.jar file.  Now put it in the appropriate place. </p>

<p> If there's something <em>wrong</em> with the bcel.jar in the lib
project, well, then you've got some development to do.  You'll need
to know some more ant targets.  But before anything, get that
<strong>bcel-5.1-src.zip</strong> and stick it in this directory.
</p>

<p> There are five top-level ant targets apart from the usual "clean":</p>

<ul>
  <li>ant extractAndJar -- this is just the composition of the extract
  and jar targets, and is the default.  It extracts the source from bcel-5.1-src.zip, 
  patches it, compiles the patched version into a jar and drops the new jar,
  bcel.jar, into the project root.  This is the default task, mainly used
  to sanity check the building and make sure we're generating something.
  The bcel.jar this generates should be the same as that in ..\lib\bcel\bcel.jar. 
  </li>
  
  <li>ant extract -- this extracts the source from bcel-5.1-src.zip,
  patches it, and copies the patched source into the project src directory, 
  there to be visible by eclipse for people to do development on it.
  </li>
  
  <li>ant jar -- this copies the edited source from the project source
  directory and jars it up into bcel.jar, there to be tested.
  </li>
  
  <li>ant push -- this pushes the new bcel.jar into ..\lib\bcel\bcel.jar, 
  ready to be used by the greater compiler.</li>
  
  <li>ant diff -- this creates the patch.txt file, composed of the differences
  between the project src directory and the original bcel-5.1 source. </li>
</ul>

<p> All of the tasks are destructive, so don't do "ant extract", for example,
if you have anything in the project source directory you care about.
