<p>The automatic installation process is complete. There are still three
steps that we recommend you perform to complete the installation:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Put <b><code>${installer.output.aspectjrt}</code></b> on your CLASSPATH.
    This 29KB .jar file contains classes that are required by any program compiled
    with the ajc compiler.</li>
  <li>Modify your PATH to include <code> <b>${installer.output.dir.bin}</b></code>.
    This will make it easier to run ajc. </li>
  <li>Download the documentation and examples from http://aspectj.org
    to learn how to use the language.</li>
</ol>

<p>These steps are described in more detail in <code>
<b>${installer.output.readme}</b></code>.</p>
