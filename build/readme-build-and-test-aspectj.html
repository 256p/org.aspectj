<h1>Build and Test AspectJ</h1>

This describes how to build and test AspectJ
for developers working on source code for AspectJ.
It covers building with Ant or Eclipse and testing with 
JUnit and the harness used for compiler tests.

For information on how the build works and how to 
debug failed builds, see

<h3>Quick start</h3>
This is a minimal introduction to building and testing AspectJ.

<p>Command-line users use CVS to check out something like this:
<pre>
  export CVS_ROOT=":pserver:anonymous@dev.eclipse.org:/home/technology"
  cvs co org.aspectj/modules</pre>
If using Eclipse, check out the subdirectories of 
<code>org.aspectj/modules</code> as Java projects.  
Skip modules <code>aspectj-attic</code> and (unless running
compiler tests) <code>tests</code> and most <code>testing*</code>
modules.  Do not skip <code>testing-utils</code>, 
which is used by other modules.

<p>Build an AspectJ distribution:
<pre>
  cd org.aspectj/modules/build
  ../lib/ant/bin/ant -f build.xml</pre>

To speed the build, Eclipse users can adopt the Eclipse-produced .class files:
<pre>  ../lib/ant/bin/ant -f build.xml -Dbuild.config=useEclipseCompiles</pre>

Install the distribution (e.g., into build/../aspectj-install):

<pre>  java -jar ../aj-build/dist/aspectj-DEVELOPMENT.jar</pre>

You can skip the GUI by specifying an existing, empty writable 
target directory using <code>-to {targDir}</code>:

<pre>  java -jar ../aj-build/dist/aspectj-DEVELOPMENT.jar -to .</pre>

Test it by running the build script in the examples directory:

<pre>  cd ../aspectj-install/doc/examples
  ../../ant/bin/ant</pre>

This should build and run the spacewar example.
  
<h3>Requirements</h3>
To build requires only the AspectJ project modules.
All necessary libraries and tools are in the 
<a href="../lib/">lib</a> directory.  For command-line users,
that usually means checking out the modules directory:
<pre>
   export CVS_ROOT=":pserver:anonymous@dev.eclipse.org:/home/technology"
   cvs co org.aspectj/modules
</pre>
Eclipse users should check out subdirectories of 
 <code>org.aspectj/modules</code> as a Java project.  

<p>Not all modules are required.
The <code>aspectj-attic</code> module only has old code,
and the <code>tests</code> and <code>testing-*</code> modules
are only needed to run tests.

<h3>Standard builds</h3>
<h4>Building using Ant</h4>
To do a build, use Ant to run <a href="build.xml">build.xml</a>
from this <a href=".">build</a> directory.  
To run Ant, use the project's <a href="../lib/ant">../lib/ant</a>
scripts and libraries, not your own.
The default target builds the AspectJ distribution;
see the <a href="build.xml">build.xml</a> for other targets.

Consider defining the following flag properties:
<p>
<table cellpadding="1" border="1">
<tr><th>Property</th><th>Meaning</th>
    </tr>
<tr><td>module.name
    </td><td>To build any module (esp. those not directly supported
             by a target), use the "any-module" target and define
             the module name.
	</td></tr>
<tr><td>check.build.jar
    </td><td>any value cause build to fail if 
    <code>lib/build/build.jar</code> is out of date.  (This is a
     built archive of the build module to avoid bootstrapping.)
	</td></tr>
<tr><td>build.config
    </td><td>override default configuration in build.xml.
     Significant values include "verbose" for more output
     and "useEclipseCompiles" to assume that Eclipse has 
     compiled modules into their bin directories, and just
     assemble those classes.
	</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
For example, to build everything into a release bundle,
with verbose logging
<pre>
  cd modules/build
  ../lib/ant/bin/ant 
</pre>

To build only the asm module (and any modules it requires):
<pre>
  cd modules/build
  ../lib/ant/bin/ant -f build.xml any-module -Dmodule.name=asm
</pre>

To build the test harness into 
  <code>../aj-build/jars/testing-drivers-all.jar</code>:
<pre>
  cd modules/build
  ../lib/ant/bin/ant -f build.xml build-testing-drivers
</pre>

<h4>Building with Eclipse</h4>
As mentioned above, the modules are Eclipse Java projects, so
once checked out, they should build as-is.  That will enable you
to run the compiler or test harness from within Eclipse (see below),
but it will not build the AspectJ release as Ant does.

<h4>Running the Ant build scripts from Eclipse</h4>
When running Ant from Eclipse, be sure to replace the Eclipse Ant 
libraries with ours.  In the Ant configuration, remove all jars 
specified by Eclipse and add all the libraries in 
<a href="../lib/ant/lib">../lib/ant/lib</a>
as well as in <a href="../lib/junit">../lib/junit</a>.
(Do not add <code>../lib/build/build.jar</code>, which is
added via a taskdef declaration.)
<p>
If you find on rebuilding that the build products are not
being regenerated, you may need to manually delete them
or restart eclipse (the files are not being closed); see
<a href="readme-build-module.html">readme-build-module.html</a>
for more information.

<h4>Using Eclipse to compile but Ant to assemble</h4>
Assuming Eclipse is compiling the AspectJ modules successfully,
you can use Ant to assemble the eclipse-build .class files into a 
product by including <code>useEclipseCompiles</code> in the 
<code>build.config</code>
variable as described above.  That reduces the build process
to product assembly, which can be completed in a couple minutes.
(And of course you can run Ant from Eclipse as described above.)

<h4>Running the compiler, browser, or harness from the command-line</h4>
The build produces jar files in 
  <a href="../aj-build/jars/">../aj-build/jars/</a>,
some of which have manifests specifying the main class, so they
can be run using <code>java -jar {file} {arguments}</code>.

<p>To run the compiler from the command-line, use the <code>ajbrowser</code> jar file:
<pre>
   java -jar aj-build/jars/ajbrowser-all.jar {compile arguments}
</pre>
This will run <code>ajbrowser</code> if you provide no arguments or
 only (unflagged) .lst file arguments.  To run the test harness,
 use the <code>testing-drivers</code> jar file:
<pre>
   java -jar aj-build/jars/testing-drivers-all.jar tests/ajcTests.xml ...
</pre>

<h4>Running the compiler, browser, or harness from Eclipse</h4>
To run things within Eclipse, create a run configuration from the
defining module using the main class:
<p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="1">
<tr><th>Program</th><th>Module</th><th>Main</th></tr>
<tr><td>AspectJ compiler</td><td>org.aspectj.ajdt.core</td><td>org.aspectj.tools.ajc.Main</td></tr>
<tr><td>AspectJ browser</td><td>ajbrowser</td><td>org.aspectj.tools.ajbrowser.Main</td></tr>
<tr><td>Test harness</td><td>testing-drivers</td><td>org.aspectj.testing.drivers.Harness</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Running Ant-built jars from Eclipse</h4>
You can run build products (built jars) from Eclipse in two ways:
<ul>
   <li>Put them on the classpath of some run configuration</li>
   <li>Select the jar files and right-click to "open with default editor"
       (assuming your system is configured to run .jar files)</li>
</ul>
You might do this to run the installer or test the browser as built.
However, doing so might prevent those jar files from being recreated
in the next build.
It appears that sometimes these jar files are not close during the
Eclipse session, which means they cannot be overwritten in new builds,
even those run from a different Ant process.
If you find that builds are silently failing, try deleting the 
build products.


<h3>Testing AspectJ</h3>
Each module has a tree of JUnit tests in the <code>testsrc</code> directory.
These parallel the <code>src</code> directories and contain roll-up suites
for each package 
  (<code>{module}/testsrc/{packagePath}/{package}Tests.java</code>) and 
for the module as a whole  
  (<code>{module}/testsrc/{module}ModuleTests.java</code>). 

<p>The AspectJ project also has <i>additional</i> custom tests in the 
  <a href="../tests">tests module</a>,
mainly the compiler tests run by the harness in 
  <a href="../tests/ajcTests.xml">ajcTests.xml</a>. <u>It is important
to run these additional compiler tests (not covered by the JUnit
suite) before and after any change to the compiler.</u>
</p>
<h4>Running JUnit tests in Eclipse</h4>
JUnit tests may be run under eclipse by selecting any JUnit source file
and creating a run configuration for it.
To run all the JUnit tests, use Ant to "build"
   <a href="../tests/junitModules.xml">../tests/junitModules.xml</a>.
This file uses the eclipse module bin directories as its classpath,
so it will not work for someone not compiling with Eclipse.

<h4>Running JUnit tests from the command-line without Eclipse</h4>
The AspectJ project committers do not do this, but it should work fine.
The trick is to build the modules with their associated test code 
(which happens by default) 
and put the resulting jars on the classpath with the JUnit harness. 

<h4>Running JUnit tests from Ant without Eclipse</h4>
This entails editing
   <a href="../tests/junitModules.xml">../tests/junitModules.xml</a>
to use a classpath containing the built module jars as described above.
[todo: update junitModules.xml with non-eclipse variant]

<h4>Using the test harness to run compiler tests</h4>
The <code>build-testing-drivers</code> target builds a single jar with
the AspectJ binaries and a test harness as the main class. 
It reads test suite files like 
   <a href="../tests/ajcTests.xml">../tests/ajcTests.xml</a>;
use the -help flag to see available options.

  <a href="../tests/readme-tests-module.html">
           ../tests/readme-tests-module.html</a>.

<h3><a name="releases"></a>Releases</h3>
<h4>Release builds</h4>
Committers do official release builds to create the distribution
released in binary form from the web site.

Release builds differ only in running
from a clean, up-to-date tree and with correct build version values
in <a href="build-properties.xml">build-properties.xml</a>, which
will update <code>org.aspectj.bridge.Version</code>.
Do not run using the <code>build.config</code> value 
<code>useEclipseCompiles</code>,
because this will include testing classes in the release libraries.
See <a href="#version">Version synchronization</a> below
for more details on how the version is updated.

<h4>Release preconditions and testing</h4>
<p>
Normally, we do releases only after fixing all high-priority
(P1 and P2) bugs in the bug database
  (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?product=AspectJ&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&priority=P1&priority=P2">
All open AspectJ bugs with P1 and P2</a>).
For bug fixes, associated tests in 
  <code>tests/ajcTestsFailing.xml</code> are fixed and moved to
  <code>tests/ajcTests.xml</code>.
  

<p>Before a release, run the release tests as described in
  <a href="../tests/readme-release-tests.html">
           ../tests/readme-release-tests.html</a>.
                      
<h4>Release completion</h4>
When the release build is accepted,
tag the tree with the release version
so others can do diffs or create patches
based on the release code.  E.g., from the command line:
<pre>
   cd org.aspectj/
   cvs tag -R -c v1_1_0
</pre>
<p>
Pushing the release out to the web involves manually updating
  <code>aspectj-home/</code> with the release files 
  (and documentation, if it is not a preview release),
  verifying the downloads and pages, 
  and sending any release notifications.
  Save the release installer, test results, and any notes 
  about deferred bugs or tests in
  <code>org.aspectj/releases/aspectj-{version}/</code>.

<h3>Build problems</h3>
Some build problems and fixes encountered in the past:
<ul>
  <li>If your compiles fail because Ant cannot find <code>javac</code>,
      put the JDK bin directory on your PATH and/or define
      the JAVA_HOME environment variable.
      Ant requires the path to the <code>javac</code> executable
      when the <code>BuildModule</code> taskdef runs.  I think it either
      gets it from <code>$JAVA_HOME</code> or if the <code>bin</code>
      directory is on the <code>PATH</code>.
   </li>
   <li>If using an IBM JDK at version 1.4 or higher within Eclipse,
   then the default value of JRE_LIB will point to the jar file
   "core.jar." Unlike the Sun JDK, IBM does not package the full
   runtime into a single jar ("rt.jar"), but instead has multiple
   jar files. Since core.jar does not contain the graphics libraries,
   several of the AspectJ projects will fail to build as checked out
   of CVS - there are missing dependencies on AWT and swing. The
   solution is to add graphics.jar to the project classpaths... BUT
   if this is added as an ordinary (external jar), then the main
   ant build script will pick up the contents of graphics.jar and
   include it in the aspectj distribution (obvious clue, the size of
   the built aspectjtools.jar doubles to about 10MB). Instead, from the 
   Java Build Path properties page of the project, select "Add Library"
   and add the JDK library. You now have to remove the JRE_LIB entry
   from the project or Eclipse complains about duplicate jar files
   in the path.
   </li>
<ul>
