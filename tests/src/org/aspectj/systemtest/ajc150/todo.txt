Work to do for 1.5.0M1

Initial support for these features is mostly to do with tolerance of them for binary weaving:

X Bridge Methods (Ignore them completely - they provide no join points)
X Covariance     (Properly support covariance)
o Varargs        (Don't allow Object[] to match a varargs method)
o Autoboxing     (
o -source 1.5    (So we can change our behavior, e.g. autoboxing)
o LocalVarTypeTable (Manipulate it the same as we do the LocalVariableTable)
X Annotations       (No ITDs allowed)
X Enums             (No ITDs allowed)
o Annotation        (No DECPs allowed)
o Enums             (No DECPs allowed)

Things not done:

Marked with XXXAJ5 - currently tagging things like:

- No covariance support for dynamic pointcut matching, need to dup declaringTypeMatch() changes for cov support

===

Things we ought to do:
- Lift binary decp restriction
- ResolvedTypeMunger - switch on remembering source location !
