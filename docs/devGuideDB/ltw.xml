        <para> The AspectJ weaver takes class files as input and produces class files as output.
            The weaving process itself can take place at one of three different times: compile-time,
            post-compile time, and load-time. The class files produced by the weaving process (and
            hence the run-time behaviour of an application) are the same regardless of the approach
            chosen. </para>
            
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem> <para>Compile-time weaving is the simplest approach. When you have the source code
                for an application, ajc will compile from source and produce woven class files as
                output. The invocation of the weaver is integral to the ajc compilation process. The
                aspects themselves may be in source or binary form. </para></listitem>
            <listitem> <para>Post-compile weaving (also sometimes called binary weaving) is used to weave
                existing class files and JAR files. As with compile-time weaving,
                the aspects used for weaving may be in source or binary form,
                and may themselves be woven by aspects. </para></listitem>
            <listitem> <para>Load-time weaving (LTW) is simply binary weaving defered until the point that
                a class loader loads a class file and defines the class to the JVM. To support this,
                one or more "weaving class loaders", either provided explicitly by the run-time
                environment or enabled through a "weaving agent" are required. </para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        
        <para> You may also hear the term "run-time weaving". We define this as the weaving of
            classes that have already been defined to the JVM (without reloading those
            classes). AspectJ 5 does not provide explicit support for run-time weaving although
            simple coding patterns can support dynamically enabling and disabling advice in aspects. </para>

            <para> By default a class file that has been woven by the AspectJ compiler cannot
                subsequently be rewoven (passed as input to the weaver). If you are developing
                AspectJ applications that are to be used in a load-time weaving environment, you
                need to specify the <literal>-Xreweavable</literal> compiler option when building
                them. This causes AspectJ to save additional state in the class files that is used
                to support subsequent reweaving. </para>
            <para>As per AspectJ 1.5.0 M3 aspects (code style or annotation style) are
            reweavable by default, and weaved classes are reweavable by default as well as per AspectJ 1.5.0 M4.</para>

        <para> All load-time weaving is done in the context of a class loader, and hence the set of
            aspects used for weaving and the types that can be woven are affected by the class
            loader delegation model. This ensures that LTW complies with the Java 2 security model.

                A visible aspect is one defined by the

            <title>Configuring Load-time Weaving with aop.xml files</title>
            
            <para>The weaver is configured using one or more <literal>META-INF/aop.xml</literal>
                files located on the class loader search path. Each file may define a list of

                should woven, and a set of options to be passed to the weaver. In addition AspectJ 5
                supports the definition of concrete aspects in XML. Aspects defined in this way
                must extend an abstract aspect visible to the weaver. The abstract aspect
                may define abstract pointcuts (but not abstract
                methods). The following example shows a simple aop.xml file: </para>

            <para>
                An aop.xml file contains two key sections: "aspects" defines one
                or more aspects to the weaver and controls which aspects are to be
                used in the weaving process; "weaver" defines weaver options and which
                types should be woven.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                The simplest way to define an aspect to the weaver is to 
                specify the fully-qualified name of the aspect type in an aspect element. 
                You can also
                declare (and define to the weaver) aspects inline in the aop.xml file.
                This is done using the "concrete-aspect" element. A concrete-aspect
                declaration must provide a pointcut definition for every abstract 
                pointcut in the abstract aspect it extends. This mechanism is a 
                useful way of externalizing configuration for infrastructure and
                auxiliary aspects where the pointcut definitions themselves can be
                considered part of the configuration of the service.
                Refer to the next section for more details.
            </para>

            <para>
                The aspects element may optionally contain one or more include and
                exclude elements (by default, all defined aspects are used for weaving).
                Specifying include or exclude elements restricts the set of defined
                aspects to be used for weaving to those that are matched by an include
                pattern, but not by an exclude pattern. The 'within' attribute accepts
                a type pattern of the same form as a within pcd, except that &amp;&amp;
                and || are replaced by 'AND' and 'OR'.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                The weaver element is used to pass options to the weaver and to specify
                the set of types that should be woven. If no include elements are specified
                then all types seen by the weaver will be woven.

            <para> When several configuration files are visible from a given weaving class loader
                their contents are conceptually merged (this applies to both aop.xml files
                and to aop.properties files as described in the next section). 
                The files are merged in the order they are
                found on the search path (regular <literal>getResourceAsStream</literal> lookup)

                If you have requirements for more complex aspect inheritance, you should consider regular aspect
                inheritance instead of concretization through XML.
