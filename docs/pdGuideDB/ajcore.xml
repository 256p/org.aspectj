        <para> When the compiler terminates abnormally, either because a particular kind of message was
        issued or an exception was thrown, an AspectJ core file will be produced. You will
        find it the working directory of the compiler and will have a name that contains
        the date and time that the file was produced 
        e.g. <literal>ajcore.20060810.173655.626.txt</literal>. </para>
