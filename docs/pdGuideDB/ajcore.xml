        <para> When the compiler terminates abnormally, either because an abort message was
        issued or an exception was thrown, a AspectJ core file will be produced. You will
        find it the working directory of the compiler and will have a name that contains
        the date and time that the file was produced 
        e.g. <literal>ajcore.20060810.173655.626.txt</literal>. </para>
