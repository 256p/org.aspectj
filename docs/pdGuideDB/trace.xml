        <para> The usual approach to opening a report on Bugzilla is to describe the symptoms of the 
        problem and attach a simple testcase. This allows the AspectJ team to try and reproduce the problem in
        an attempt to fix it as well as improve the test suite. Unfortunately it may not be possible
        to produce such a testcase either because your program is too large or is comercially sensitive. Alternatively 
        the problem may relate to your specific environment where AspectJ is being used and will not be
        reproducible by the AspectJ team. In one of these situations you may be asked to produce a
        trace of the compiler when the problem occurs instead. This can then be attached to the bug report. </para>
