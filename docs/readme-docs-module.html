<h1>AspectJ docs</h1>

The AspectJ docs include native sources (html and word files)
and XML DocBook files used to produce the FAQ and guides.
The <a href="dist">dist</a> directory contains the native files
as they are delivered with the distribution, and the 
docbook directories 
 <a href="faq">faq</a>,
 <a href="progGuideDB">progGuideDB</a>, and
 <a href="devGuideDB">devGuideDB</a>
contain sources for the FAQ and the Programming and Development Guides,
generated using the Ant <a href="build.xml">build.xml</a> script.

<p>
<u>Build</u>: The script uses a taskdefs defined in ../lib/build/build.jar
to generate the installers, and others to do misc. text-conversion.
Dependencies outside this directory:
<ul>
<li>.xml files refer to their docbook dtds using relative
    path, for the moment ../../lib/docbook/...
    </li>
<li>When building docbook, uses ../lib/saxon libraries.
    </li>
<li>When building installer, using ../lib/build/build.jar
    and the ../build/installer-resources.
    </li>
</ul>
