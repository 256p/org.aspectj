This contains links to other instances of AspectJ sample code.
It doesn't contain links to all articles that have AspectJ
sample code, but arguably it should.

<!--
The links should be written to render nicely and briefly in HTML,
but each source/topic should be segregated using different
sample tags.  Having this file make sense on its own would
be good as well.

<!-- START-SAMPLE pubs-papers-aodesignpatterns Aspect-Oriented Design Pattern Implementations -->
<u>Aspect-Oriented Design Pattern Implementations</u> by Jan Hanneman with Gregor Kiczales
renders some of the original "Gang of Four" design patterns using AspectJ
to evaluate whether AspectJ increases modularity.  
In 17 of 23 cases, this removed code-level dependencies, 
and 12 cases were rendered as reusable library aspects.

<!-- START-SAMPLE pubs-projects-atrack ATrack bug tracker  -->
The <a href="https://atrack.dev.java.net/">aTrack project</a>
aims to create an open source bug tracking application that 
demonstrates use of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) with AspectJ. 
It uses AOP pragmatically to provide systematic support for 
technical, middleware, and business concerns.

<!-- START-SAMPLE pubs-projects-cricketcage CricketCage JUnit test generator  -->
The <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cricketcage/">
CricketCage project</a>
automatically creates JUnit TestCases for repeatable bugs and test 
scenarios. Include Cricket Cage's AspectJ code to install a code 
generator, then run the program to generate the TestCase.
