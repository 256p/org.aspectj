    <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
      <listitem>
	<para>introduces the AspectJ language</para>
      </listitem> 

      <listitem>
	<para>

      <listitem>

	  provides examples of their use.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    Three appendices give a quick reference, a more formal definition of
    AspectJ, and a glossary.
  </para>

  <para>The first section, <xref linkend="gettingstarted" />, provides a gentle
    overview of writing AspectJ programs. It also shows how one can introduce
    AspectJ into an existing development effort in stages, reducing the
    associated risk. You should read this section if this is your first
    exposure to AspectJ and you want to get a sense of what AspectJ is all
    about.</para>

  <para>The second section, <xref linkend="aspectjlanguage" />, covers the
    features of the language in more detail, using code snippets as examples.
    The entire language is covered, and after reading this section, you should
    be able to use all the features of the language correctly.</para>

  <para>The next section, <xref linkend="examples" />, comprises a set of
    complete programs that not only show the features being used, but also try
    to illustrate recommended practice. You should read this section after you
    are familiar with the elements of AspectJ.</para>
  
  <para>The back matter contains several appendices that cover AspectJ's
    semantics, a quick reference to the language, a glossary of terms and the
    index.</para>
