    Discuss detection of common errors -> warning/error, eg. conjunction of more than one
    kind of join point. Differing numbers of args in method signature / args / @args /
    @parameters. Binding of formals (cannot bind same formal more than once in a conjunction, 
    can bind exactly once in each branch of a disjunction, iff the branches are mutually
    exclusive based on e.g. join point kind).
