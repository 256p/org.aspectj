        This guide describes the changes to the AspectJ language
        and tools in AspectJ 5. These include support for Java 5 (Tiger) features,
        enhancements to load-time weaving, an support for an annotation-based
        development style for aspects.
        If you are new to AspectJ, we recommend you start 
        by reading the programming guide.

      <para>
         This is a draft document and is <emphasis>subject to change</emphasis> before
         the design and implementation is complete. There is also no guarantee that all
         of the features in this document will be implemented in a 1.5.0 release - some
         may be deferred until 1.5.1 or even later. In general, features in which we
         have more confidence in the design will be implemented earlier, providing a 
         framework for user feedback and direction setting on features for which the
         use cases are less obvious at time of writing.
