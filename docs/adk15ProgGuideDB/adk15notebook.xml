        This guide describes the changes to the AspectJ language
        in version 1.5. These changes are primarily, but not exclusively,
        to support Java 5.0 (Tiger) features.
        If you are new to AspectJ, we recommend you start 
        by reading the programming guide.

      <para>
         This is a draft document and is <emphasis>subject to change</emphasis> before
         the design and implementation is complete. There is also no guarantee that all
         of the features in this document will be implemented in a 1.5.0 release - some
         may be deferred until 1.5.1 or even later. In general, features in which we
         have more confidence in the design will be implemented earlier, providing a 
         framework for user feedback and direction setting on features for which the
         use cases are less obvious at time of writing.
